** Sass styles have the same structures as components. So,
** are structured with a variant of atomic design: Atoms,

**    Unities: is a variables file with the standard sizes
**    for general elements, for example, contains margins,
**    paddings, etc.

** Each atomic file also contains your own config variables
** for specific styles and has styles on block marked with
** Acomments.
** A block style is defined with a block comment like of
** the first line of this document. By another hand, each
** block can have block children, and those are defined with
** a block comment but with double *
